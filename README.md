## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Proposed Solution
The solution is a multilingual, AI-powered advisory platform (mobile app + chatbot + voice assistant) that delivers personalized, real-time recommendations to farmers.

How it addresses the problem:

Provides localized, scientific guidance for crop selection, fertilizer usage, and pest management.

Integrates weather forecasts and soil data to optimize farming decisions.

Supports low-literacy farmers through voice-based interaction and native language translation.

Reduces dependency on shopkeepers’ advice and promotes sustainable farming.

Innovation and uniqueness:

Combines AI, IoT (soil sensors), and computer vision (pest/disease detection).

Works in offline/low-network conditions using lightweight AI models.

Voice-first interface designed for low-literacy farmers.

Market integration to track crop prices and suggest profitable options.

## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used:

Programming Languages: Python (AI/ML), Java/Kotlin (Android), JavaScript/React Native (cross-platform).

Frameworks & Tools: TensorFlow/PyTorch (ML), FastAPI/Django (backend), Firebase/AWS (cloud hosting), OpenWeather API, Government agri-datasets.

Hardware (optional for advanced version): Low-cost IoT soil sensors.

Methodology and process:

Data Collection: Soil data, weather data, crop history, pest images.

AI/ML Models: Train models for pest detection, yield prediction, fertilizer recommendation.

App Development: Multilingual UI + chatbot + voice assistant.

Integration: APIs for weather, market prices, and government schemes.

Pilot Testing: Deploy in select Punjab villages, collect farmer feedback.

Scale Up: Expand to other regions and crops.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: High, as mobile penetration in rural India is over 70%, and low-cost smartphones are widely available. Existing AI/ML models can be adapted to local datasets.

Challenges & Risks:

Low digital literacy among farmers.

Limited internet connectivity in rural areas.

Initial resistance to adopting new technology.

Strategies to Overcome:

Voice-first and offline support.

Partnering with local agricultural officers and NGOs for training.

Government subsidies or free distribution for early adoption.


Potential Impact:

Increased crop yield and reduced input costs for farmers.

Improved decision-making based on real-time, scientific insights.

Greater resilience to climate change through predictive weather alerts.

Benefits:

Social: Empowerment of small farmers, reduced dependence on middlemen.

Economic: Higher incomes, better access to markets.

Environmental: Sustainable fertilizer and pesticide use, reduced soil/water pollution
